### Functionality:
- **Real-time Updates**: Search and filter results update immediately
- **Smart Defaults**: Sensible default selections

- **Filter Persistence**: Maintains filter state during session

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for a production version:

1. **Integration with Microsoft Graph API** for real group data
2. **Advanced group search** with autocomplete
3. **Group hierarchy support** (nested groups, parent/child relationships)
4. **Permission-based filtering** (only show groups user can access)
5. **Recent groups** shortcuts for frequently accessed groups
6. **Group metadata display** (member count, description, etc.)
7. **Bulk operations** on group content
8. **Group-specific search scopes** and saved searches

## Demo Instructions

To see the Groups filter in action:

1. Open the prototype in your browser
2. Note the search results for "group"
3. In the left sidebar, locate the "Groups" filter with the "NEW" badge
4. Select "Specific group" radio button
5. Click in the group search box to see available groups
6. Select "Trading Agreements" or "Analysts Groups"
7. Observe how the results filter to show only content from that group
8. Also try checking "Groups" under "Knowledge sources" to see group-specific content

The prototype demonstrates how this new feature would integrate seamlessly into the existing Copilot Search experience while providing powerful new filtering capabilities for group-based content discovery.
